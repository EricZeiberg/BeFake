# BeFake

A Flutter app for performing actions on your BeReal profile

## Features
- Post photos from camera roll
- See posts without having posted that day
- Download BeReals without the user being notified 
- More coming soon...

## Usage

Simply clone the repo and execute `flutter run`. Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed. If running for Web, change the built in proxy server to one that you control, as the demo might not be live for long. 

A demo is currently live at: [ericzeiberg.github.io/BeFake](http://ericzeiberg.github.io/BeFake)
